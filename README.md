# Floating Dock

An Apple-style floating dock for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org): pinned
launchers along the bottom of the screen, hover magnification, a launch
bounce, running-app indicators, and a glassy capsule look. Built as a
native `omarchy-shell` plugin (same tech as the bar/OSD), so it's themed
automatically and survives theme switches.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/<your-username>/omarchy-apple-dock.git --enable
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/omarchy-apple-dock.git ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/dino.dock
omarchy plugin enable dino.dock
```

> Plugins run as arbitrary, unsandboxed code inside your long-lived
> `omarchy-shell` process. Read `Dock.qml` before enabling anything you
> didn't write yourself — this one included.

## Configuring pinned apps

Edit `pinned.json` in the plugin directory
(`~/.config/omarchy/plugins/dino.dock/pinned.json`) — a plain JSON array
of desktop-entry IDs, left to right:

```json
["foot", "org.gnome.Nautilus", "chromium", "..."]
```

The ID is the `.desktop` filename without the extension. List what's
installed with:

```bash
ls /usr/share/applications/*.desktop | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.desktop$//'
```

Saving the file hot-reloads the dock immediately — no restart needed.

- **10–12 is the sweet spot** for icon size at full magnification.
- **20 is the hard cap** — entries past 20 are dropped (a warning is
  logged to the shell's console output).
- Past ~12–14 pinned apps, icons start shrinking to keep the dock under
  ~86% of screen width, the same way the real macOS dock does.

## Configuring which monitor it shows on

On a single-monitor setup you don't need to do anything — the dock uses
whichever screen Quickshell enumerates first.

On a multi-monitor setup, create `monitor.json` next to `pinned.json`
with a substring of the target screen's manufacturer, model, or connector
name (case-insensitive):

```json
"Odyssey G50F"
```

or just:

```json
"DP-2"
```

Matching by manufacturer/model survives a docking station renumbering
connectors across reboots; matching by connector name alone doesn't. No
`monitor.json`, or an empty one, means no preference. This file also
hot-reloads on save.

## How it behaves

- **Click** a pinned icon: focuses its window if one is already open,
  otherwise launches it (via the shared `AppLibrary` service — same
  launch path as the Omarchy menu).
- **Hover**: icons magnify with distance-based falloff, like the macOS
  dock.
- **Running indicator**: a small accent-colored dot appears under any
  pinned app with an open window. Matching is done by comparing the
  window's Wayland `app_id` against the desktop entry's ID/name — this is
  a heuristic (Wayland has no fully reliable "this app_id came from this
  .desktop file" mapping), so if a running dot doesn't light up for a
  particular app, its `app_id` doesn't match closely enough; nothing to
  fix on the launch side, it just won't show the dot.

## Updating

```bash
omarchy plugin update dino.dock
```

## Removing / disabling

```bash
omarchy plugin remove dino.dock
```

or manually: delete the plugin directory and remove the `{"id":
"dino.dock"}` entry from the `plugins` array in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`.

## Files

- `manifest.json` — plugin manifest (kind: `panel`, `keepLoaded: true` so
  it's mounted at shell startup and stays up, like the OSD).
- `Dock.qml` — the implementation.
- `pinned.json` — your pinned-app list (edit this, not `Dock.qml`).
- `monitor.json` — optional, only needed on multi-monitor setups.
